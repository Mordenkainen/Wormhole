Wormhole
==========

A mod about moving things via the End.

This mod adds a collection of blocks and items that will enable you to wirelessly transfer items, fluids, and energy to and from blocks and the players inventory. It also add items allowing single use teleportation and custom portals.

Most features are still W.I.P. Currently working features are:
 - Wormhole Anchor: A single use teleporter. Right click while standing at your destination to save it. Right click again to teleport there. Wormhole Anchors can be "reset" by cooking them in a furnace.

 - PlayerLink: Allows pipes, hoppers, etc. to access the linked players inventory. Top access the armor slots, any side the main inventory, and bottom the hotbar. In addition, if RF or EU is sent into it, it will recharge all chargeable items in the players inventory. To link, right click after placement. This will cause a small amount of damage. to unlink, right click again. Once linked only the linked player and server OP's can break the block. This block can be hidden using the Camouflage Tool detailed below. If this block is picked up using a silktouch pick it will retain ownership and camouflage from then on (no silktouch is needed to pick it up again), to clear this, unlink the block.

 - Camouflage Tool: Shift-RightClick on most blocks will link the tool to that block. Shift-RightClicking on a PlayerLink will cause the PlayerLink to camouflage as the linked block. Right-Click on empty space to unlink the tool. Shift-RightClicking on a PlayerLink will de-camouflage the block.
